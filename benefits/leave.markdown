# Benefits - Leave

## Vacation

In a perfect world, this section would be one sentence: "Take as much as you need, but no more than you can handle." However, anecdotal evidence shows that unlimited vacation quickly turns into zero vacation. Let's try this instead: new employees start with 3 weeks (15 days) of paid vacation, granted when you start working. After one year of full time employment, you get 4 weeks of paid vacation per year. Of course you have to coordinate this vacation so that we meet our time commitments and everyone's not gone at once, but beyond that the weeks are yours. One other requirement: you should take at least one week (5 business days) of vacation per full year of employment.

## Holidays

Gemini uses the following holiday schedule:

- New Year's Day
- Easter
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Veterans Day
- Day before Thanksgiving
- Thanksgiving Day
- Friday after Thanksgiving
- Christmas Eve
- Christmas Day

In addition, the week between Christmas and New Year's Day is considered a "quiet period". You should
keep current on client contacts and emails, but otherwise it's an extended holiday to relax and
recharge for the upcoming year.

## Sick Leave

Sick leave is granted when you get sick, and ends when you're not sick anymore. Please don't get anyone else sick.

## Jury Duty

Jury duty is a solemn civic responsibility, and we're all about that stuff. Do It! Jury duty will not count against your vacation time.
