# Discrimination

Don't Do It! We want the most qualified people possible working here (because they're generally the most fun to be around), so we don't discriminate based on age, sex, race, religion, disability, or tabs vs spaces. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, so if you have a characteristic that you're unsure of, the answer is "no we don't discriminate based on that." Easy!
