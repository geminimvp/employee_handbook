# being a manual of culture and operations

Greetings! This employee handbook serves as the written record of
Gemini's values, goals, and policies. Its primary goal is

DON'T BE BORING

Beyond that, it serves as a reference standard by which we can measure
our own actions. Will we always live up to the standards set in here?
Unlikely, but we'll give it our best.
